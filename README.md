# Data-Science-Project-1

This project analyzes global data science salaries across roles, experience levels, and countries to inform strategic hiring decisions for a small but growing firm.



## Project Overview

Business Question: 
What salary range should our firm offer to attract and retain top data science talent to help implement data initiatives across the organization?


Context for Consideration: 
We are a small but fast-growing company looking to build out our data science capabilities.
 The role (or roles) could be remote or in-office, U.S. based or international. 

***When considering salary expectations and team size, we must also ask: What does driving data science within our organization actually look like? This will help us determine whether we need a single expert or a team with varying levels of experience/background.***


Key Questions to Consider 
â€¢ How do salaries vary across different data science roles? 
â€¢ What are the salary expectations in the U.S. vs. overseas? 
â€¢ How does remote work impact salary? Should we pay less for remote work? 
â€¢ What is the salary difference by experience level? Should we hire a single expert or build a diverse team? 
â€¢ Whatâ€™s a competitive, budget-conscious offer we can make given our small company size?


***Note: The provided dataset only includes salaries by country, not by U.S. state. State-level salary could provide futher insights for our strategy, but will be omitted as it is outside the scope of this dataset.


## Key Insights

- 40% salary jump between Mid-Level and Senior-Level roles
- Data Scientists are the highest paid across experience levels
- Entry-Level roles (Analyst & Engineer) offer strong value with small pay gap
- U.S.-based employees earn ~40â€“60% more than international counterparts

## Final Team Recommendation

| Role                                               | Location                  | Proposed Salary (USD) |

| Senior Data Scientist                  | U.S.                          | $170,000               
| Entry-Level Data Engineer         | International            | $59,000                
| Entry-Level Data Analyst           | International            | $54,000                

- Hire senior Data Scientist in the U.S. (onsite or hybrid) to lead and implement data strategy
- Hire entry-level roles internationally to reduce cost while offering competitive global pay
